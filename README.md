## About

_A bullshit-bingo to play with your weeb friends at conventions._

Because me and a few friends of mine always play some kind of convention bingo with a sheet we pull from google images every time in the last minute, I decided to make our lives a little easier and learn a take the opportunity to learn something new by creating this app.

This is already the third iteration this application is going through. While the [first one](https://github.com/Rankarusu/ConventionBingo) used only vanilla JS and SCSS, I tried to build this with [Vue and Ionic](https://github.com/Rankarusu/ConBingo2), but I was so disappointed by the performance that I decided to go with a more native approach this time. Because I need to learn React for work soon anyway, React Native was the obvious choice this time.

## Installation

### Android

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.conbingo&pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1"><img width="200" alt="Get it on Google Play" src="https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png"/></a>

### iOS

An Apple Developer License costs 100â‚¬/year, which is way too expensive for a fun little app like this.

I'll try to get this project to build for the web as well, so you'll have to use this.
